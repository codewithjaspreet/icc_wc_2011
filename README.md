## Web Scraping

In this section, we'll explain the web scraping process used to gather crucial data related to the ICC Men's 2011 World Cup. We utilized Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to automate Google Chrome browser interactions and collect comprehensive match details, batting statistics, and bowling statistics.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Selenium: Selenium is a widely-used tool for automating web browsers, making it an ideal choice for dynamic web scraping tasks.
Google Chrome: We employed the Google Chrome web browser as the platform for our scraping activities due to its compatibility with Selenium.
